          <h2><span class="workspan">Description Of Tree</span></h2>
          <p>
            In botany, a
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree">tree(details)</a> is a
            perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, usually supporting
            branches and leaves. In some usages, the definition of a tree may be
            narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth, plants
            that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. In
            wider definitions, the taller palms, tree ferns, bananas, and
            bamboos are also trees. Trees are not a monophyletic taxonomic group
            but consist of a wide variety of plant species that have
            independently evolved a trunk and branches as a way to tower above
            other plants to
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgOFzu2o06k"
              >compete for sunlight.</a
            >
            The majority of tree species are angiosperms or hardwoods; of the
            rest, many are gymnosperms or softwoods. Trees tend to be
            long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old. Trees have
            been in existence for 370 million years. It is estimated that there
            are around three trillion mature trees in the world. A tree
            <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/tree-branch"
              >typically has many secondary branches</a
            >
            supported clear of the ground by the trunk. This trunk typically
            contains woody tissue for strength, and vascular tissue to carry
            materials from one part of the tree to another. For most trees it is
            surrounded by a layer of bark which serves as a protective barrier.
            Below the ground, the roots branch and spread out widely; they serve
            to anchor the tree and extract moisture and
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNCmrLgZ2uU"
              >nutrients from the soil.</a
            >
            Above ground, the branches divide into smaller branches and shoots.
            The shoots typically bear leaves, which capture light energy and
            convert it into sugars by photosynthesis, providing the food for the
            tree's growth and development.

          rees are plants and carry out the life processes that all plants
          share. However, trees are not actually a scientific group of their
          own. Trees may be cone-bearing plants

          Tree ferns are technically not trees as they do not contain wood. All
          the groups of plants that include trees are vascular plants. This
          means they have vascular tissues called
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rihF7x03fg"
            >xylem and phloem.</a
          >
          Xylem and phloem link all parts of the plant, transporting water,
          minerals and manufactured food around while also forming part of the
          structural support for plants.

          <li>Avoid products made with palm oil.</li>
          <li>Use less paper.</li>
          <li>Buy recycled paper products.</li>
          <li>Go for cloth products over paper when possible.</li>
          <li>Push your local government to do more for trees.</li>
          <li>Look for volunteering opportunities to plant/protect trees.</li>
          <li>Eat less meat</li>

        <h2><span class="workspan">Why we should save tree? </span></h2>
        <p>
          Trees contribute directly to the environment by providing oxygen,
          improving air quality, climate amelioration, conserving water,
          preserving soil, and supporting wildlife. During the process of
          photosynthesis, trees take in carbon dioxide and produce the oxygen we
          breathe.

            <ol>
              <li>
                Trees give us fresh air to breathe by taking in carbon dioxide
                and releasing oxygen.
              </li>
              <li>
                They provide a home and food for many animals, insects, and
                birds.
              </li>
              <li>
                Trees help to keep the climate cool and prevent global warming.
              </li>
              <li>
                They help to prevent soil erosion by holding the soil together
                with their roots.
              </li>
              <li>
                Trees give us fruits, nuts, and seeds to eat, which are healthy
                and tasty.
              </li>
              <li>
                We use wood from trees to make things like furniture, paper, and
                pencils.
              </li>
              <li>
                Trees provide shade on hot, sunny days, making it more
                comfortable to play outside.
              </li>
              <li>
                They help to clean the air by absorbing harmful pollutants and
                dust.
              </li>
              <li>
                Planting trees can create beautiful landscapes and make our
                surroundings more attractive.
              </li>
              <li>
                Trees can help us feel more relaxed and connected to nature,
                improving our mood and well-being.
